## 🧩 Assignment 1 — Convert a Struct into a Class

### 📝 Problem Statement
Convert the given `struct` into a `class` while maintaining the same member variables.

### 💡 Objective
Understand the difference between `struct` and `class` in C++:
- `struct` members are **public by default**
- `class` members are **private by default**

## 🧩 Assignment 2 — Function Overloading (`sum()`)

### 📝 Problem Statement
Implement a class `Calculator` that overloads the `sum()` function to handle both:
- Two integers  
- Two floats  

### 💡 Objective
Demonstrate **compile-time polymorphism** in C++ using **function overloading**.
