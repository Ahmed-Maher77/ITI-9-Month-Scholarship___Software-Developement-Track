# 🎓 Computer Networks & Cyber Security Foundations — ITI 9-Month Journey
## Lesson 1: Understanding Network Essentials

A computer network is more than devices and cables — it's a structured system for sharing resources efficiently.  
Here are some foundational concepts:

---

### 🖥️ What is a Computer Network?

A collection of devices connected through communication media to share resources such as:

- Files  
- Printers  
- Software  
- Voice/Video communication  
- Internet access  

---

### 🚀 Network Elements

#### 🔹 Hardware
- **Devices:** Computers, Routers, Switches, Printers  
- **Media:** Wired, Wireless, Satellite  

#### 🔹 Software
- **Messages:** email, WhatsApp, data packets  
- **Protocols:** HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, RDP  

> **Note:** Protocols define how messages flow, ensuring efficient communication.

---

### 🏷️ Key Terminologies

- **NIC (Network Interface Card):** Connects a device to the network  
- **MAC Address:** Unique physical address burned into NIC  
- **IP Address:** Logical address assigned to identify devices over a network  
- **Topology:** How devices are physically/logically arranged  
- **Protocols:** Rules for communication  

---

### 🔌 Network Devices

- **Hub:** Broadcasts data to all devices → slow  
- **Switch:** Sends data only to the destination device → efficient  
- **Router:** Connects different networks  
- **Access Point:** Connects Wi-Fi clients to a wired network  
- **Repeater:** Regenerates signals to extend network range
