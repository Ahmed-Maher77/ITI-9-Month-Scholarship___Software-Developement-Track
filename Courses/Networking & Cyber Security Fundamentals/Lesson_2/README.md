# 🎓 Computer Networks & Cyber Security Foundations — ITI 9-Month Journey  
## Lesson 2: Types of Networks — From Homes to Global Communication  

Understanding how networks are classified helps us visualize how communication scales — from a personal workspace to the entire globe.

---

## 🌐 1️⃣ Personal Area Network (PAN)

A small network covering a very short range (within a person’s workspace).  
Common examples include:

- Bluetooth headsets  
- Smartphone tethering  
- Laptop–mobile connections  

**Ideal for:** Personal wireless communication.

---

## 🏠 2️⃣ Local Area Network (LAN)

Covers a small geographic area such as:

- Homes  
- Offices  
- Schools  
- Campuses  

**Key Features:**

- High speed  
- Low cost  
- Easy to manage  
- Fully controlled by the organization  

Most modern LANs rely on **Ethernet** or **Wi-Fi** technologies.

---

## 🏙️ 3️⃣ Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

Covers a city or a large campus (up to ~100 km).  
Commonly used by:

- Universities  
- Government institutions  
- Telecom providers  

A MAN offers **high-performance connectivity** between multiple LANs in a metropolitan region.

---

## 🌍 4️⃣ Wide Area Network (WAN)

Covers large geographic regions such as a **country, continent, or the entire globe**.  
Examples:

- Telecom networks  
- Corporate branch networks  
- The Internet (largest WAN)  

**Characteristics:**

- Slower speeds compared to LAN/MAN  
- High latency  
- Managed by ISPs  
- Uses public infrastructure: fiber, satellites, undersea cables  

---

## 🌐 The Internet — The Global Network of Networks

No single organization owns the Internet.  
Instead, it’s governed by global bodies such as:

- **ISOC** — Internet Society  
- **IETF** — Internet Engineering Task Force  
- **ICANN** — Manages domain names & IP address allocation  

The Internet is a massive WAN created by interconnecting millions of networks worldwide.

## 📘 Why Understanding Network Types Matters

Each network type differs in:

- Performance  
- Cost  
- Security requirements  
- Scalability  
- Use cases  

Mastering these concepts is essential for designing, troubleshooting, and securing modern communication systems.
