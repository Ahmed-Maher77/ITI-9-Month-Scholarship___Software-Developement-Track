## Lesson 3: Network Topologies — The Architecture Behind Communication

Network topology describes how devices are arranged and interconnected in a network.  
The chosen topology directly affects performance, scalability, cost, and fault tolerance.

This lesson covers the most common topologies used in modern networks.

---

### 🧱 1️⃣ Bus Topology
A single central cable (backbone) connects all devices.

**✔️ Advantages**
- Simple design  
- Low cost

**❌ Disadvantages**
- A single cable failure brings down the entire network

---

### ⭐ 2️⃣ Star Topology
All devices connect to a central switch or hub.

**✔️ Advantages**
- Easy to manage  
- Highly scalable  

**❌ Disadvantages**
- Central device failure affects the whole network

---

### 🔁 3️⃣ Ring Topology
Devices are connected in a circular loop, with data traveling in one direction.

**✔️ Advantages**
- Provides equal access to the network

**❌ Disadvantages**
- A single device failure can disrupt the entire ring

---

### 🕸️ 4️⃣ Mesh Topology
Every device connects to every other device.

**✔️ Advantages**
- Highest level of redundancy  
- Excellent reliability  

**❌ Disadvantages**
- Expensive due to many cables and ports

---

### 🧬 5️⃣ Hybrid Topology
A combination of two or more topologies (e.g., Star + Bus).

**✔️ Advantages**
- Flexible and scalable  
- Suitable for large environments

---

### 📌 Summary
Choosing the right topology depends on factors like:
- Network size  
- Performance requirements  
- Budget  
- Desired reliability
