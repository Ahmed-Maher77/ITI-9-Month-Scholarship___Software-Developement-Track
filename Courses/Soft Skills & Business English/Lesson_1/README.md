### Breaking the Ice
Our first session focused on introductions and speaking entirely in English.

We shared:
- Education — college, university, degree, and graduation project  
- Experience — work, internships, or volunteer roles  
- Projects — individual and team projects  
- Skills — both technical and soft skills  
- Hobbies and interests  

We also discussed:
- Unique habits of group members  
- Favorite foods and international cuisines such as American, Egyptian, and Korean  
- Cultural differences and how they influence communication styles  
- Session rule: all communication was conducted in English

### Writing Practice
**Topic:**  
> In many countries, fast food is becoming cheaper and more widely available. Do the disadvantages of this outweigh the advantages?

Through this exercise, we learned to:
- Structure arguments logically  
- Express balanced opinions  
- Use linking expressions effectively (however, on the other hand, as a result)  
- Write concise and persuasive paragraphs

### Grammar in Context

#### Present Simple
Used for:
- Facts → “The sun rises in the east.”  
- Habits → “I read every morning.”  
- Timetables → “The class starts at 9:00 a.m.”

#### Present Continuous
Used for:
- Actions happening now → “I’m studying English.”  
- Temporary actions → “I’m staying in Alexandria for the summer.”  
- Future plans → “I’m meeting my supervisor tomorrow.”

**Example Correction:**

- ✅ I’m staying in Alex (temporary situation)

### Pronunciation Practice
We practiced pronunciation of tricky plural forms:
- **months** → /mʌnθs/ (sounds like “monts”)  
- **clothes** → /kloʊðz/ (sounds like “cloz”)

1. How ambitious are you?

3. Where do you want to be in 10 years?  
4. Would you rather:
