We learned the correct structure and tone of formal workplace emails.  
The trainer explained the components of a **professional email**, including:

| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **To:** | The primary recipient of the message. |
| **Cc (Carbon Copy):** | Used to include others who should *see* the message and responses. |
| **Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy):** | Used to include others who should *see* the message but remain hidden from other recipients. |
| **From:** | The sender of the email. |
| **Subject:** | A concise, clear phrase that represents the content of the email. |

**Email Body Structure:**
1. **Salutation:** Greet the recipient professionally (e.g., *Dear Mr. Hossam,*).  
2. **Opening:** Provide a short introduction and explain the reason for writing.  
3. **Main Content:** Present your message in a clear, logical, and polite way.  
4. **Closing:** End with a professional closing line.

This activity strengthened our **decision-making, reasoning, and persuasive writing skills**.
