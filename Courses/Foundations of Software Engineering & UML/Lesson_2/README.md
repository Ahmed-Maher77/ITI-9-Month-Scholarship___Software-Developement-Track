# 🎓 Software Engineering & UML — ITI 9-Month Journey  
## Lesson 2 — Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is the backbone of professional software development.  
It defines how successful teams **plan, build, test, deploy, and maintain** high-quality software.

In this lesson, we explored each SDLC phase and how it contributes to delivering reliable, scalable, and user-focused systems.

---

## 🔹 1. Requirements Phase — *“What should we build?”*

Activities:
- Gather customer and stakeholder needs  
- Define functional and non-functional requirements  
- Prepare the **SRS (Software Requirements Specification)**  
- Use tools such as interviews, surveys, prototypes, and use cases  

📌 **Output:** A clear, validated description of what the system must do.

---

## 🔹 2. Design Phase — *“How will we build it?”*

Activities:
- System and architectural design  
- Database schema and data flow design  
- UML diagrams (Class, Sequence, Use Case, Activity)  
- Selecting technologies and applying design patterns  

📌 **Output:** High-level and detailed design documents.

---

## 🔹 3. Implementation (Coding) Phase — *“Let’s build it!”*

Activities:
- Write code following the approved design  
- Apply coding standards and best practices  
- Use version control (Git, branching strategies)  
- Integrate modules into a cohesive system  

📌 **Output:** Fully developed and integrated software modules.

---

## 🔹 4. Testing Phase — *“Does it work correctly?”*

Activities:
- Unit testing (components)  
- Integration testing (modules)  
- System testing (end-to-end)  
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)  
- Automated testing and regression testing  

📌 **Output:** Verified, validated, and quality-assured software.

---

## 🔹 5. Deployment Phase — *“Deliver to users!”*

Activities:
- Deploy to production or app stores  
- Provide documentation, manuals, and training  
- Monitor logs and performance metrics  
- Apply hotfixes or patches if needed  

📌 **Output:** Live, accessible software for end-users.

---

## 🔹 6. Maintenance Phase — *“Keep improving!”*

Activities:
- Fix newly discovered issues  
- Add enhancements and new features  
- Optimize performance and scalability  
- Adapt to OS, hardware, or security updates  

📌 **Output:** A stable, evolving, and continuously improved system.

---

## ⭐ Key Takeaways

- SDLC provides **structure, discipline, and predictability** to software projects.  
- Every phase has a clear purpose, activities, and deliverables.  
- Following SDLC reduces risks, improves quality, and ensures project success.
